"""Hot-URL promotion into the Cloudflare KV edge cache.

A :class:`HotUrlAction` (registered in the click worker when
``EDGE_CACHE_*`` is configured): when the hotness detector fires, look
the URL up fresh, gate it through the eligibility rules, and write a
redirect entry into KV. From then until the entry's TTL, the edge
Worker serves that URL's redirects without touching origin.

The lookup is deliberately just ``UrlCache.get``: a URL hot enough to
fire the detector was resolved by the redirect route seconds ago, and
``resolve()`` populates the cache on every miss — so the entry is
present by construction, and exactly as fresh as the cache-invalidation
discipline that the rest of the system already relies on. A miss (worker
restarted mid-burst, cache evicted) is skipped, not repaired: the next
hot window re-fires.
