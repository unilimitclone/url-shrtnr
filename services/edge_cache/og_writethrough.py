"""Eager KV write-through for custom meta-tags (edge-first serving).

On every meta-relevant write, origin renders the OG page once and puts an
``og_only`` entry in Workers KV so the edge answers preview bots with zero
origin round-trips. Humans always pass through (the worker only serves
``og_only`` entries to preview crawlers), so click tracking is unaffected.

Lifecycle: put on set/edit, delete on clear/deactivate/delete. The put
carries a TTL (refreshed on every edit) as a backstop — it bounds how
long a stale entry can linger if a delete fails or a status change skips
update() (e.g. an admin sets BLOCKED directly in Mongo).

Best-effort like promotion: a KV outage must never fail a user's API
write — worst case bots reach origin, which answers correctly.

Scope: system-domain v2 links only. Custom-domain tenants never route
through the worker (CF-for-SaaS), so KV entries for them would be dead
weight; origin serves their previews directly.
