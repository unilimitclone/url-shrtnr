"""TenantResolver protocol — Host header → tenant info, hot-path cached.

The middleware (PR4) calls ``resolve(host)`` on every request and stamps
``request.state.domain`` so downstream handlers can scope queries by
tenant. Returning ``None`` means "this host is not a known tenant" and
the route layer should 404.
