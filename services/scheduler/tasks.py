"""Built-in task registrations.

``build_task_registry`` is the single composition point for scheduled
tasks — the app (dependencies/wiring.py) and the click worker both build
their registry here so a task registered once exists in whichever process
hosts the runner. Feature tasks take their dependencies as arguments and
gate themselves on their own settings.
