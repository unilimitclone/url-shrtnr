"""Task registry and next-run math.

Code is the source of truth for WHAT tasks exist and WHEN they recur; Mongo
(``scheduled_tasks``) is the source of truth for runtime state (enabled,
next_run_at, lease, last_run). Handlers are plain async callables returning
an optional detail dict — they must be idempotent, because execution is
at-least-once (a crashed run re-claims after its lease expires).
