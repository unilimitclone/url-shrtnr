"""Producer sinks for safety analysis events.

Three rungs, mirroring the click pipeline's degradation ladder:

- RedisStreamSafetySink — queue Redis present: the worker analyzes async.
- InlineSafetySink — no queue Redis: analyze in-process, still after the
  trigger's own work is stored (the analyzer is best-effort by contract).
- NullSafetySink — safety disabled: emit is a no-op.

Emit errors are logged and swallowed: a report must store and a link must
redirect regardless of the safety pipeline's health.
