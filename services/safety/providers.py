"""Analysis providers — the pluggable judgment sources.

Each provider inspects one signal and either returns a verdict or
abstains (None). Providers must never raise on bad input or backend
failure: safety analysis is best-effort by contract and a broken provider
degrades to abstention, not to a stuck queue. The chain is ordered; the
first non-abstaining provider wins.

v1 ships the local sources (operator blocklists). The deep tier (page
render + LLM) plugs in here as another provider without touching the
pipeline.
