"""UrlPolicyService — the L0 create/edit gate.

One gate, three callers (v2 create, v2 edit, both legacy creation routes).
It reuses the analyzer's providers — the SAME instances, composed by the
wiring into a cheap/local subset — so a signal is implemented once and
fires at two moments: here it refuses the write, in the analyzer it
writes a verdict and enforces.

Output is a ``PolicyRejection``, not a harm verdict: each caller owns its
wire shape (v2 raises ValidationError, the legacy routes return their
frozen JSON bodies). Security rejections stay COARSE on the wire ("URL is
blocked") while the precise provider and reason go to logs — a precise
error message is an evasion oracle.

Failure discipline matches the rest of the funnel: a provider error is an
abstention (the provider logs it), so a broken feed or a Mongo hiccup can
never take down link creation.
