"""CreationPatternScorer — L1: the signal no external feed can see.

Fixed-window Redis counters over link CREATION (the hotness detector's
math pointed at creates instead of clicks): creates per destination
registrable domain, at a burst window (minutes) and a daily window. A
counter crossing its threshold pushes the destination into the same
analyzer the reports feed (`trigger="pattern"`).

There is deliberately NO per-IP counter: the rate limiter already bounds
per-IP volume, real campaigns concentrate on destination domains (the
92-day replay confirmed it), and an IP is a terrible creator identity
(CGNAT/VPNs) with no reviewable object behind it — a creator-level
signal belongs to an account ban ladder, not to IP counters.

Counters live on the QUEUE Redis (noeviction): the cache Redis runs
allkeys-lru and would silently evict them. No queue Redis means scoring
is a no-op — pattern detection is an enhancement, never a dependency.
Everything here is best-effort by contract: record_create never raises
and never blocks a write.

Thresholds are private tuning (SAFETY_L1_* env vars, never committed):
calibrate by replaying past campaigns against candidate values.
