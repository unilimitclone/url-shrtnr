"""L3 sweeps — retroactive coverage. Never iterates links: iterates the
small set (a feed's sync delta, the recent window's distinct hosts) and
uses the dest index into the corpus.

Two sweep kinds ship here:

- **Feed delta** (no schedule of its own): each feed SYNC task calls
  ``FeedDeltaSweeper.sweep`` with the domains new in that sync — existing
  links pointing at a freshly listed domain get their host enqueued for
  analysis within the same task run.
- **Recent screening** (scheduled): distinct destination hosts created in
  the recent window that have no verdict yet get screened, capped per
  run. Unresolved sweep screenings write their verdict silently (the
  analyzer's trigger-aware notification rule), so this never spams the
  operator channel.

Registration follows the feeds discipline: ``build_sweep_tasks`` is the
catalog — a new sweep rule is one factory plus one list entry, and the
scheduler, wiring and worker never change.
