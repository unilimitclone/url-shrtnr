"""Admission policy — the one readable rule between screening and
investigation.

Screening (the cheap provider chain) runs for every trigger on one shared
queue. Investigation (the deep tier: outbound calls, renders, the model)
has its own queue and consumer, and is entered ONLY through this policy
when screening ends unresolved. The asymmetry between a report and a
sweep lives here, in one function, instead of as hidden pipeline
behavior:

- ``report``             — admitted within its OWN, larger daily budget.
  Reports are the P0 lane, but they are also the only trigger an outsider
  can pull (anonymous, 40 submissions/day/IP, wildcard DNS for unlimited
  fresh hosts), so priority cannot mean unbudgeted: without a ceiling one
  IP owns the investigation bill.
- ``edit``               — always admitted. A destination edited after
  creation is the bait-and-switch shape; the trigger only exists for
  authenticated links.
- ``pattern``            — admitted within the shared daily budget.
  Bursts are anomalies worth spending on, but a counter, not a blank
  check.
- ``sweep``              — never admitted by default. Sweep novelty keeps
  its uncertain verdict; coverage is screening's job, not the deep
  tier's. ``SAFETY_DEEP_ADMIT_SWEEPS`` opts sweeps into the same budget.

The budget is a fixed-window counter in the durable queue Redis (the
cache Redis would evict it). Redis being down fails CLOSED for
budget-bound triggers (reports included) — investigation is the expensive
tier, and "we couldn't count, so spend freely" is the wrong failure mode.
A denied report still reaches the human review embed, so nothing is lost
silently.
