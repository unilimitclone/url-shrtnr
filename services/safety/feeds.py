"""External threat-feed integrations — FEED_REGISTRY is the catalog as code.

One ``FeedSpec`` entry per feed drives everything (same discipline as the
webhook EVENT_REGISTRY, so nothing can drift): which chains the feed joins
(create gate / analyzer), its config switch, its optional sync task, its
optional first-boot seed, and its L0 wire message. Adding a feed = one
registry entry — the gate, analyzer, wiring, worker and seeder never
change. All feed DATA lives in one place (``safety_feed_domains``), read
through ``FeedDomainProvider`` membership lookups.

Feeds are additive signal sources — a feed being down, stale, or
unconfigured only ever means abstention, never a broken pipeline.

fishfish.gg: community-run scam-domain feed (strong on the Discord
ecosystem). ``GET /v1/domains`` returns a flat JSON array of domain
strings, no auth required for the domain list.
