"""SafetyAnalyzer — provider chain → verdict store → enforcement/notify.

The single orchestration point every trigger funnels through, in whichever
process hosts it (worker consumer or inline sink). Semantics:

- A verdict fresher than ``reverdict_ttl`` short-circuits analysis; an
  existing TOXIC verdict re-runs enforcement idempotently instead (new
  links to an already-judged destination die without re-analysis),
  bounded by the verdict's scope.
- First non-abstaining provider wins. No provider judging means tier
  UNCERTAIN and a human review embed — BENIGN is never inferred from
  absence of evidence.
- Screening enforces exactly as far as its signal reaches. A curated feed
  naming a host is a host-wide call and needs no second opinion; anything
  narrower blocks the links it covers and escalates the host question to
  the deep tier.
- Everything is best-effort: analysis failures log and drop, they never
  propagate into the trigger path (a report must store even when analysis
  is broken).
