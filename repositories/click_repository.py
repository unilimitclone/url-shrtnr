"""
Repository for the `clicks` MongoDB time-series collection.

The clicks collection has a strict schema requirement:
  - timeField: "clicked_at"  (datetime)
  - metaField: "meta"        (ClickMeta subdoc with url_id, short_code, owner_id)

All aggregation pipelines are passed in from the service layer — the repository
does not build pipelines itself.
