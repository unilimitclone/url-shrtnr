"""PostHog person deletion for the account-erasure cascade.

HTTP implementation of the ``PostHogEraser`` protocol
(``services/account_erasure_service.py``). Uses PostHog's
bulk-delete-by-distinct-id API, which removes the person AND their
events — the analytics half of a GDPR Art. 17 erasure.

Strictly best-effort: any failure (non-2xx, network error) is logged as
a warning and swallowed. The cascade must never park an account in
PENDING_DELETION because the analytics vendor is down; the step is
idempotent, so a retried sweep repeats it for free.
