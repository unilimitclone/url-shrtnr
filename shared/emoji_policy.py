"""
v2 emoji-alias policy — canonicalization, RGI-subset validation, and
generation-pool derivation. Pure, framework-agnostic, stateless.

Why a policy exists at all: browsers resolve any percent-encoded path, but
many emoji are byte-fragile (the same glyph can be produced with or without
an invisible ``U+FE0F`` variation selector) or don't render on major
platforms (ZWJ sequences split apart, regional-indicator flags show as bare
letters on Chromium/Windows, tag sequences can smuggle invisible data).
The v1 system accepted all of them; this module is the fix.

Accepted graphemes are RGI *fully-qualified* sequences that are either a
single codepoint (which, for single codepoints, implies default emoji
presentation — no ``U+FE0F`` ever needed) or a base + skin-tone modifier.
Everything else — VS16-dependent symbols, ZWJ sequences, keycaps, flags,
tag sequences, standalone components — is rejected by construction.

Legacy resolution stays on ``shared.validators.is_emoji_alias`` (lenient,
no policy); THIS module governs everything newly created. Like the other
``shared`` validators, nothing here reads settings — every knob is a
parameter with a module-level default, enforced by the service layer.
