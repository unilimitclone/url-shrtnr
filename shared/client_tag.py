X-Spoo-Client header parsing — shared by the logging middleware and routes.

First-party clients identify themselves with ``X-Spoo-Client: <slug>`` or
``<slug>/<version>`` (e.g. ``snap/2.1.0``). Values that do not match the
shape are treated as absent, never rejected — the header is advisory
telemetry, not an auth surface.
