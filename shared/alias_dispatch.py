"""Alias-resolution dispatch order — single source of truth.

Which URL generation answers a short code is a public contract shared by
every resolving surface (the redirect via ``UrlService._dispatch`` and
the public preview endpoint). The order lives here as one pure function
so the surfaces can never drift: if the length heuristic ever changes,
both learn about it together — otherwise the preview could describe one
link while the redirect serves another under the same code.

Mirrors the original get_url_by_length_and_type() heuristic:
  emoji alias → urlsV2 first, emojis collection fallback
  6 chars     → urls (v1) first, urlsV2 fallback
  anything else → urlsV2 first, urls (v1) fallback
(7-char codes were historically an explicit branch, but their v2-first
order is identical to the default. Emoji originally resolved against the
emojis collection only; v2 comes first now that emoji aliases are created
as urlsV2 rows — creation-time collision checks against the legacy
collection guarantee a v2 hit can never shadow a live legacy variant.)

Emoji codes look up under two forms, and the split is deliberate:
urlsV2 stores only the canonical form (``shared.emoji_policy``), while
legacy ``emojis`` ``_id``s are whatever bytes v1 accepted — so v2 reads
use :func:`v2_lookup_code` and legacy reads try each of
:func:`emoji_lookup_candidates` (raw first, exact legacy semantics).
