"""Tripwire: A/B variants must not go live before safety can see them.

Variants add destinations exactly like geo rules do. Safety enforcement
matches ``dest.host`` or ``dest.secondary_hosts``; a variant host that is
never stamped there matches nothing. AB_VARIANTS_ENABLED keeps the feature
dark; this test fails the moment it is flipped without the stamping work.

A/B variants were enabled but safety cannot see variant destinations.
Required before shipping them:

  1. pass the variant URLs as ``variants=`` to UrlDestination.for_link at
     every write point (create, update, backfill) so secondary_hosts
     carries them
  2. include variant URLs in link_destination_urls callers (report intake,
     hot screening, the L1 create-time burst counter) via
     shared.url_utils.link_destination_urls_for, the one place that reads
     a link's fields, so all three stay in sync as fields are added
  3. stamp existing links: scripts/backfill_url_dest.py
  4. add the variant URLs to _ALL_URLS in repositories/url_repository.py so
     the sweeps sample a variant host's own URL (today: long_url, geo rules,
     ab_variants, and every field in shared.url_utils.SINGLE_DESTINATION_FIELDS)
