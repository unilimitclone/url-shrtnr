"""
Response DTO for GET /api/v1/emoji-set.

A static, build-time-derived catalogue of the emoji-alias acceptance
policy so clients (e.g. an emoji picker) have one source of truth instead
of replicating the rules. Each accepted emoji carries its name so a picker
can offer search by name rather than making users scroll a thousand-plus
glyphs. DTO serializes only — the derivation lives in
``shared.emoji_policy`` and is assembled in the route.
