"""Response DTOs for bulk URL operations (``POST /api/v1/urls/bulk/*``).

One grammar for every bulk op: a summary plus exactly one result row
per unique requested id. The report is the contract — the summary is
derived from the rows, never tracked separately, and a batch that ran
always answers 200 with this shape even when every item failed
(per-item failures are answers, not errors; 4xx is reserved for
envelope rejection where zero items were attempted).
