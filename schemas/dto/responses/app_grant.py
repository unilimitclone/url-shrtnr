"""
Response DTOs for GET /api/v1/apps.

AppGrantResponse      — one connected app (active device-auth grant)
AppGrantsListResponse — GET /api/v1/apps (200)

The wire serves the spoo-landing Apps page (lib/api/apps.ts). Grants carry
the effective scope slugs plus their derived consent sentences; legacy
grants (pre-scopes) surface an empty scope list and the full-access
sentence.
