"""Webhook document models.

Three collections:
- ``webhook-endpoints``  — subscriptions + signing material + health
- ``webhook-events``     — the fact, stored ONCE per occurrence
- ``webhook-deliveries`` — thin per-endpoint delivery state referencing the event

The ``whsec_…`` signing secret is shown once at creation and stored
AES-GCM encrypted (never plaintext, never hash-only — the server signs
with it at delivery time, so it must be readable back).
