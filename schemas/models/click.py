"""
Click document model.

Maps to the `clicks` MongoDB time-series collection.

Time-series schema:
  timeField  = "clicked_at"
  metaField  = "meta"
  granularity = "seconds"

The `meta` subdocument groups clicks by URL for efficient range queries.
owner_id always holds an ObjectId — anonymous clicks use ANONYMOUS_OWNER_ID
to avoid bucket churn from mixed None/ObjectId types.
