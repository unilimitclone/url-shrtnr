"""Document model for the ``safety_verdicts`` collection.

One verdict per destination HOST — many short links to one scam host share
a single judgment, computed once by whichever detection layer got there
first and enforced by reading, never recomputing, at the edges. Host
granularity (not registrable domain) keeps shared platforms (workers.dev,
free hosts) from being collectively punished; domain-wide action stays a
deliberate operator move.
