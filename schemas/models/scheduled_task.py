"""Document model for the ``scheduled_tasks`` collection.

One doc per registered task; ``_id`` is the task NAME (string), not an
ObjectId — the name is the natural unique key and the doc is upserted by
registry sync at startup. Runtime state (enabled, next_run_at, lease,
last_run) lives here; the task's code and schedule source of truth live in
the in-process registry (services/scheduler/registry.py).
