"""GET /api/v1/public/preview/{short_code} — public link preview.

The wire behind the frontend's /{code}+ page. No auth dependency at all:
the response is identical for everyone, owners included. Resolution is
status-agnostic (expired / inactive / blocked links still answer 200 with
their status stated; only truly missing codes 404), but the destination
rides the wire only while the link is active and not password-protected.
Ships dark until the frontend + Caddy serve the page.
