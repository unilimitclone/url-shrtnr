GET    /api/v1/urls                    — list authenticated user's shortened URLs
GET    /api/v1/urls/{url_id}           — fetch one owned URL by ObjectId
GET    /api/v1/urls/{domain}/{alias}   — fetch one owned URL by its natural key
DELETE /api/v1/urls?domain=            — bulk-delete URLs scoped to one custom domain

Requires authentication. Listing returns paginated list with camelCase keys.
Single-resource GETs serve the exact same item shape the list serves per
element, are status-blind for the owner, and answer 404 for foreign links
(ownership is in the query — no existence oracle).
Bulk delete is owner-scoped and refuses the system-default namespace.

Route-ordering note: FastAPI matches routes in definition order. The two
single-resource GETs cannot shadow each other (different segment counts)
nor the management routes on the same shapes (those are PATCH/DELETE —
method filtering keeps them apart), and the literal ``/urls`` list/bulk
routes never match a subpath.
